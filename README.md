## My process

### Built with

- HTML (some semantic)
- SASS/CSS
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I picked this project as a kind of starting point to seeing what [frontendmentor.io](http://frontendmentor.io) was all about. I've found that some sites label things "junior" or "newbie" feel far from newbie to - or are written in a way that just ends up confusing someone that's new to the entire world of web-based languages.

It's been a while since I did any front-end (or back-end for that matter) so I figured starting simple would be a good way to dust off the cobwebs, so to speak.

### Continued development

My aim is to become more comfortable using SASS, since it makes working with CSS far more pleasant, and vanilla JS/TS. I initially learned JS in conjuction with frameworks that did a lot of heavy lifting for me - so as I move to transition out of the Army and into web development I want to be sure to close those gaps.
